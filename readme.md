# The First Webpage

## The following is a guide to my very first website designed completely on my own. This website will contain 3 pages; an intro page describing myself, a page to contact me, and finally a page with links to my completed projects. I will be using components such as 'float,' 'padding,' 'margin' and 'overflow' to accomplish creating this website.

## Contact Page
# The contact portion was relatively straightforward, as all of the CSS design for header, footer and background image had been completed, it was just a matter of creating a box on the page with 2 input forms and a submit button and spacing the box out, a process we had learned last week. I used the style element to accurately size the margins of the input boxes as the picture had.
