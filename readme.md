# The First Webpage

## The following is a guide to my very first website designed completely on my own. This website will contain 3 pages; an intro page describing myself, a page to contact me, and finally a page with links to my completed projects. I will be using components such as 'float,' 'padding,' 'margin' and 'overflow' to accomplish creating this website.

## Header
# For the header, I was tasked with bolding my name with a teal background and creating a navbar. For the name at the top I simply followed the style guide and moved the margins to orient it correctly, and for the navbar, I created a list using element <ul> and ensuring that it was inline, as lists naturally show up in a box form.

## About Me
# The about me section started with a box, and from there was a matter of selecting an image and coming up with a short bio and then orienting these items to how they are in the picture.

## Contact Page
# The contact portion was relatively straightforward, as all of the CSS design for header, footer and background image had been completed, it was just a matter of creating a box on the page with 2 input forms and a submit button and spacing the box out, a process we had learned last week. I used the style element to accurately size the margins of the input boxes as the picture had.

## Portfolio Page
# The portfolio or gallery page was quite possibly the most involved, and was a process of shifting the margins of both the images and the links while activating overflow and relative positioning. It wasn't difficult per se but time consuming.
